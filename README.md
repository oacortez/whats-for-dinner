## Challenges
What was difficult & how you would like to improve on code/project ?
What was very diffucult for me is trying to implement CSS flex which I am very new to and figure out ways to make my project exactly as the comp I got provided. I Would like to improve my code by adding new functionality like making my "Add A Recipe" Button to function and as well adding a loging page where users have the ability to log in and be able to select and as well see there favorite recipe.
